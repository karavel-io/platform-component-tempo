## How to use this repository

To create a new platform component using this template, simply click on the big "Use this template" green button on GitHub.
This will bring you to the new repository form where you can fill in the information about the new repo.

Once this is done, clone the newly created repository and run the `setup.sh` script located in the root. It will prompt you
for some information like the component name and upstream links, edit the files to replace the placeholder values and destroy itself.
